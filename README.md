- **Open-source LLMs**: Setting up GPU environments, working with HuggingFace models, and creating UIs with Streamlit.
- **Vector Databases**: Vector search, embedding creation, and offline retrieval evaluation.
- **Evaluation and Monitoring**: Offline evaluation, metrics like cosine similarity and LLM-as-a-Judge, and using Grafana for dashboard visualization.
- **LLM Orchestration and Ingestion**: Data ingestion with tools like Mage.
- **Best Practices**: Improving RAG pipelines, hybrid search, document reranking, and using LangChain.
- **Hands-on Project**: Building an end-to-end project with pre-processing text datasets. **You can find this project under LLM_WisdomWhisperer github repository**
